- Add alert (Printf() & Die()) that if ASLR/NetBSD is detected, tsan isn't possible.
  Technically we can workaround it with ReExec() and similar tricks
  but since it can be disabled on per-application basis - require it on NetBSD for
  tsan aware applications.
  This might be comparable in future for msan/NetBSD.
- FreeBSD reports issue in AsanTSDInit(), it calls pthread_key_create() while
  libthr.so is not loaded, and that causes pthread_key_create() to always return
  ENOSYS. https://reviews.llvm.org/D39254
  Check whether it is valid for NetBSD.
- Fix remaining issues in Sanitizers.
  - missing reallocarr(3) and reallocarray(3) interceptors
  - missing proper check for "struct xxx_args" stored in "data"
    parameter of mount interceptors
  - ioctl(2)-related issues
  - singal-related issues
  - missing check for "FILE" type
  - getchar(3)/putchar(3)-related issues
- Interceptors for the set{ut,utx,pw,netgr,gr,host,serv,pass}ent() family of
  functions
